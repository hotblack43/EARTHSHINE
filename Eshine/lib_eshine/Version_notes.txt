General note: Should do something about subroutine names that use mixed
UPPER and LoWeR case - as the usage is not consistent across Windows
and Linux. E.g. CalcTransformMatrix.pro and calctransformmatrix.pro

Version 16 vs version 15:


Extra FITS header for Modified Julian data added
Fixed the seconds field in the FITS header
Writing INFO JPG and IDEAL images to such named directories
Attempt to speed CalcTransformMatrix.pro up by reusing trig calculations
Furnished routine to read the albedo maps as binary files - perhaps it speeds the code up? No?


Version 13 vs. Version 12:

1) an added sutroutine 'generate_ccd.pro' is called from eshine_core to
construct a realistic CCD image.  generate_ccd.pro writes out relastic
simulated dark frames (i.e. bias + dark current + readout noise) as well
as a simulated flat field.

2) the call to eshine_core is slightly modified, and eshine_13 is modified
accordingly, but the GUI is not.

3) the FITs files that are written out have header information that
reflect the settings for the simulation.

4) a sky contribution is added by eshine_core but does not have noise -
the noise may be added in generate_ccd.pro

5) The use of a '/' on TUX for designating a path or file name has been
inserted, because '\' is used in Windows. Change back if code crashes
on a Windows machine.

6) an incompatibility TUX/Windows was revealed in upper case used in
subroutine names, and the names of the subroutines on disk have been
altered to all lower case.
